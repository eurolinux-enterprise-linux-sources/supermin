%description
Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances.  These are tiny
appliances (similar to virtual machines), usually around 100KB in
size, which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a
second when you need to boot one of them.

# files from a data file.  The program does not in fact require an
# executable stack.  The easiest way to fix this is to clear the flag
# here.
